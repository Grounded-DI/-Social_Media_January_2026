# Grounded DI OS — The First Enterprise Runtime for Deterministic AI

**Deterministic Intelligence (DI²)** is the foundation of verifiable, zero-drift AI. Every module in the Grounded DI OS follows a strict invariant:

> **One Input → One Output**  
> **SHA-256 Sealed = Auditable Proof**  
> **Entropy Lock: ∆H = 0.0041 (Global)**

This repository documents the **Midnight Blue Runtime**, a fully deterministic operating layer designed for high-stakes enterprise use across legal, financial, infrastructure, and compliance systems.

## Core Capabilities

- ✅ Zero-variance execution (`BriefWise`, `VerdictBridge`, `PIDBot`)
- ✅ Drift-shielded analytics (`FinanceWise`, `MarketWise`)
- ✅ Infrastructure-safe logic layers (`StormWise`, `RealEstatePro`)
- ✅ Environmental enforcement (`HazardWise`, `CleanWaterWise`, `CleanAirWise`)
- ✅ FastPath 5.2 enforcement with regional continuity + failover

## Auditable AI = Trust at Scale

DI² is the system-of-record for:
- Legal trial logic (Rule 702 / Frye compliant)
- Global deterministic mesh replication
- Enterprise failover with zero state loss
- Structural hybrid model integration (guardrails for generative AI)

## Why This Matters

In 2026, **deterministic AI** is the **trust currency**.  
It’s the “recipe card” that stabilizes generative models, anchors enterprise decision-making, and protects against drift-induced failure.

> Grounded DI OS doesn’t just run stable — it proves it.
